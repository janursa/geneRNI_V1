degradation concept:
assuming that alpha is .1 (/day), what estimator predicting? 
- in time series: 
	prediction = rate of change including degradation = dy/dt + a*y
- in steady: 
	prediction = decay amount = y + a*y


how to combine static and dynamic data: 
- case 1: dont include alpha in static data
		- simply merge them

In addition to this main challenge participants also had the option of taking part in a bonus-round challenge aimed at assessing a methodâ€™s ability to predict system-wide behavior in response to new genetic perturbations, the double knock-out challenge. For each network participants were also presented with twenty double knock-out perturbations (in which the transcription rate ofa pair of genes was set to zero simultaneously), and asked to predict the steady-state expression of all other genes in response to the perturbation.
