degradation concept:
assuming that alpha is .1 (/day), what estimator predicting? 
- in time series: 
	prediction = rate of change including degradation = dy/dt + a*y
- in steady: 
	prediction = decay amount = y + a*y


how to combine static and dynamic data: 
- case 1: dont include alpha in static data
		- simply merge them

implement KO in process data (both time series and static), outputlinks, 
param search for a fraction of genes
